# QUANTITATIVE METHODS AND MODELLING 

## Project Assignment 13  Edi Graovac

The file cats.csv contains measurements of body weights and hearth weights for male and female 
cats: 
- sex – male (M) or female (F) 
- bwt – body weight in kg 
- hwt – heart weight in g 

The goal of your project assignment is to analyse heart weight with the emphasis on comparing male 
and female cats.
1. Perform descriptive analysis of heart weight, separately for male and female cats. Descriptive 
analysis must include: 
    - mean, five number summary, range, interquartile range, and standard deviation, 
    - visualize the distribution of heart weight using appropriate plots. 
2. Test if heart weight is normally distributed both graphically and through hypothesis testing, 
separately for male and female cats. 
3. Compute 95% confidence interval for the mean and standard deviation of heart weight, 
separately for male and female cats. 
4. Test if the variances of heart weight between male and female are equal. 
5. Test if the means of heart weight between male and female are equal. 
6. Compute 95% confidence interval for the difference in the means of heart weight between 
male and female cats.
